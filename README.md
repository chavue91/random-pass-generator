Password Generator

This is a random password generator. The user selects from four criteria that they would like to include in their random password. These criterias are password length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric and/or special characters. When the user clicks on the red "Generate Password" button a series of prompts will occur which selects the criteria for the random password to generate. Once each prompt field has been selected a random password with the criterias will print on the screen which allows the user to copy and paste the random password.

Thank you for using this random password generator.
